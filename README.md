## Questions

1. Do you have to initialize git everytime you open a file in the terminal? For example: if you want to manipulate the folder would you ever use 'rm -r -fo .git' and then later reinitialize?

2. Which commands are a one off run and then which ones must be run everytime you use git? For example: Do I have to run git push -u origin main every time I want to push changes or do I just run it once and then I can just use git push?
